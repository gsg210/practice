<h2>Week 1</h2>
<p><em>July 27, 2018</em></p>
<p>I've been at this for only a few days, and it has been one of the most frustrating--yet rewarding--experiences. My coding experience up to this point has been extremely limited, and I've never kept at it long enough to keep my skills fresh in my mind.</p>
<p>Coding is <em>nothing</em> like riding a bike. It's not something that you never forget. Back in the day when GeoCities was a thing (showing my age here!) I loved playing around with HTML and making my page a shrine to all the loves of my life, which, at the time, consisted of Aerosmith and cats (I know, right?!). But as technology evolved, GeoCities was pushed out of the picture. I wish I had saved my page before it vanished into the big Recycling Bin in the sky. Oh well. Here I am now.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it's been years since I've coded in any appreciable capacity. I worked a little bit with it at a previous job in 2013 or so, but even that is long enough to bring me back to square one. Throughout this break, I've toyed with the idea of learning web development, but never committed the time to it. It always looked so daunting. "Real" code, everything beyond what I learned to build my GeoCities page, seemed too overwhelming to take in. </p>
<p>And granted, I still get that overwhelmed feeling, but the difference is that I've become motivated to <em>overcome</em> it.</p>  
<p>A couple of months ago, I started looking into a local coding bootcamp program, a 24-week intensive course that would teach front-end and back-end web development. Ultimately, I enrolled in it and was assigned a little bit of pre-work prior to the first class to get my feet wet.</p>
<p>As I do with many things, I procrastinated. <em>A lot.</em> But at the eleventh hour, I put my nose to the grindstone and (mostly) figured it out--with the help of Google and my husband, who has a bit of a computer science background.</p>
<p>Two classes in, and I'm no longer completely overwhelmed at the idea of coding. From the get-go I started thinking of ways I could use my new skills upon completion of the course. And with only 2 days of class under my belt, I've already come up with several app ideas, including one that would be instrumental in streamlining workflow at my current job.</p>
<p>There's a saying that came up in my first class: <strong>Always Be Coding</strong>. In case you're not familiar with it, it's loosely based on a quote from the movie <em>Glengarry Glen Ross</em>: "Always Be Closing." One of my previous jobs actually introduced me to that quote. Anyhow, I digress.</p>
<p>It's easy to see why one should Always Be Coding. I can see myself stepping away from this for just a week and forgetting the little things... the little things that can break the code you worked hours (even days!) to write.</p>
<p>As I was writing this, I actually agonized over the fact that my font color would not change to silver as I told it to. Want to know why it didn't? Because I used "font-color" instead of "color" in CSS.</p>
<p>I ran into a few similar roadblocks during my pre-work assignment before class, and powered through. And here I am.</p>
<p>This page is to document my journey through my coding bootcamp. Today, I'm using basic HTML and CSS elements. At the end, I hope to have integrated as much as I possibly can using the skills I gain through the course.</p>
<p>So there you have it.</p>
<p><strong>Always Be Coding.</strong></p>
