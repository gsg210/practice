<h2>Week 1: Mistakes Were Made Edition</h2>
<p>Initially I wrote up my own page in HTML, with a little bit of CSS thrown in to make it *fancy*.</p>
<p>As the title states, mistakes were made. But hey, that's how you learn!</p>
<p>Like I said in the original entry, I used "font-color" instead of "color" to change my font color to silver. Rookie mistake! </p>
<p>Next, I pulled the CSS style sheet from my Thursday class. It all started out just fine - I created a CSS file in the same folder as the one where this HTML file is located. However, I failed to change the link, which caused my new link to point at a non-existent directory. Easy enough, I got it! </p>
<p>All things considered, I feel like I did OK. A little bit of experimenting, and I was able to change the margin and assign a color to the h1 tag that allowed my header to show instead of fade into the background.</p>
<p>I'll get there :) </p>
